# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site/magazine, which should be responsive and work for mobile, tablet and desktop screens. The webpage should consist of a header with navbar and logo, a "big news section" including an image and an article text and a "small news section" including images with captions. The main objectives were to practise flexbox and media queries. Using CSS grid was a stretch goal.  

## The problem

I chose to make a crafty e-zine to involve my own hobbies. I used my own photos and wrote some text and headlines. I like creating content myself. I wanted to give the webpage a crafty-looking design. 

Since I had some experience with flexbox I aimed for the stretch goals and created my webpage layout using CSS grid combined with flexbox. Looking into CSS grid I found the grid template areas easy to grasp, so I used that. First thing I did was to sketch what the webpage should look like in Jamboard, but my ideas focused on the content and choosing the theme, images and captions. My layouts were very close to the layout sketches provided by Technigo. I edited the images in Photopea, so they would be a good size and ratio from the start. I figured out the details of the design during the project. If I had had more time I would have liked to make more advanced animations.
